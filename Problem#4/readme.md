LAB: Filter and sort a list
Write a program that gets a list of integers from input, and outputs negative integers in descending order (highest to lowest).

Ex: If the input is:

    10 -7 4 -39 -6 12 -2
the output is:

    -2 -6 -7 -39 
For coding simplicity, follow every output value by a space. Do not end with newline.
